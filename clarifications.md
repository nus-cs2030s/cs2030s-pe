# Q3 clarification:

Format should be 

  - `name + " (" + weight + " g)"`
    
instead of 

  - `name + " ( " + weight + "g)"`


# format.sh

The test files `Test1.java` `Test2.java` and `Test3.java` cannot be edited by default.  When you try to format it with `./format.sh` it is normal to see an error similar to this:

```

  Test1.java: could not write file: Test1.java
  Test2.java: could not write file: Test2.java
  Test3.java: could not write file: Test3.java

```
<br>
The java code you wrote will still be properly formatted.
