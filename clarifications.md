# Question 4

On Page 3, Line 3, it says:
<br>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The class <code>Student</code> also overrides <code>toString</code> to ..
</blockquote> 
<br>
It should say:
<br>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The class <code>EnrolledStudent</code> also overrides <code>toString</code> to ..
</blockquote> 
<br>
<br>

# format.sh
<br>
The test files `Test1.java` `Test2.java` and `Test3.java` cannot be edited by default.  When you try to format it with `./format.sh` it is normal to see an error similar to this:

```

  Test1.java: could not write file: Test1.java
  Test2.java: could not write file: Test2.java
  Test3.java: could not write file: Test3.java

```
<br>
The java code you wrote will still be properly formatted.
